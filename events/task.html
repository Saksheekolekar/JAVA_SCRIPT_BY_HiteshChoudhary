	object_2: { 
		object_3: 7 
	} 
}; 

// In this example, create two objects 
// One object is referred by another 
// as one of its properties. Currently, 
// none can be garbage collected 

// The "object_4" variable is the second 
// thing that has a reference to the object 
var object_4 = object_1; 


// The object that was originally in 
// "object_1" has a unique reference 
// embodied by the "object_4" variable 
object_1 = 1; 
console.log("second",object_4);
//Reference to "object_2" property of 
// the object. This object now has 2 
// references: 1 as a property, 
// The other as the "object_5" variable. 
var object_5 = object_4.object_2; 
console.log(object_5);
// The object that was in "object_1" has 
// now zero references to it. It can be 
// garbage-collected. However its "object_2" 
// property is still referenced by the 
// "object_5" variable, so it cannot be freed. 
object_4 = "Geeks For Geeks"; 
console.log(object_4);
// Now the "object_2" property has no 
// references to it and hence it can 
// be garbage collected. 

console.log("r",object_5);
